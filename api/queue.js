// Floating coach week — the "what's next" rule for web-push reminders. The queue's normalization,
// completion, and pin rules come from shared/queue-core.js, which the frontend also imports.
// This module keeps the reminder's time-zone and weekday adapters separate and can be unit-tested
// without booting the whole server. `S.queue` is written by a planner — any API client that PUTs
// state with a queue (a coaching agent, a script) — or by the frontend's own rotation feature
// (marked by `rotationId`; see frontend/src/lib/rotation.js). Three rules live here:
//
// DONE RULE (shared with the frontend, and the rule a planner has to mirror): a queue session
// counts as done once a finished workout on its routine exists, started at/after the queue was
// applied (`S.queue.since`) — or a "past workout" logged with an early clock but DATED inside the
// week (on or after `startsOn`) whose merged name (`'A + B'`) names the routine under its current
// title. The date bound keeps a past week's workout, which a planner's reused ids and names can
// make look identical, from counting. Only finished workouts (`S.workouts`) count; an in-progress
// session never does. Missed sets are the planner's business, not the queue's. A queue with
// `strict: true` (the app's "Start new pass") drops the dated name clause: only a workout started
// at/after `since` counts, so a session logged earlier that day stays the old pass's.
//
// NEXT RULE (shared with the frontend): once `startsOn` is reached, the day's session is the
// first not-done one in slot order — unless pins say otherwise.
//
// PINS (shared with the frontend; a planner need not read them — `dayPlan` is the athlete's): the
// day sheet can give a session a day by writing the per-date override that already exists,
// `S.dayPlan[iso] = <queue routine id>`; nothing new is stored. An active pin is a dayPlan entry
// dated today or later that names a session still to do. On its day the pinned session is the
// day's session, ahead of the floating order; on every other day from today on the floating rule
// skips it. A pin on a past day is stale (the session floats again), and a pin on a done session
// is fulfilled (`pinState === 'done'`) and reads as no override at all. Pins change which session
// is NEXT, never what counts as DONE, so the tally a planner reads is untouched.
